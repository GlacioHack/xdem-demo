# xdem demo
A set of notebooks and scripts to demonstrate xdem features.

These can be launched on mybinder using this button [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GlacioHack/xdem-demo/HEAD)

Then navigate into the notebook folder and open any of the examples. The python scripts should turn into nice Jupyer notebooks thanks to [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext).
